Downloads
---------

Go to [Releases](https://github.com/shivawu/topcoder-greed/releases) page.

* [2.0-beta](https://github.com/shivawu/topcoder-greed/releases/download/2.0-beta/Greed-2.0-beta.jar)
* Legacy [1.5](https://github.com/shivawu/topcoder-greed/releases/download/1.5/Greed-1.5.jar)  
  Note that the 2.0 is not compatible with 1.x versions. Latest versions are recommended.

Quick start
-----------
1. Go to [Downloads], and download the single Greed jar.
   The binary is compatible with Java 1.6+.

2. Open __Topcoder arena__ -> __Login__ -> __Options__ -> __Editor__ -> __Add__  
![Add greed](https://github.com/shivawu/topcoder-greed/wiki/images/Add-Plugin.png)<br/>
Done! Remember to check __Default__ and __At startup__.

3. Click __Configure__.  
![Configure greed](https://github.com/shivawu/topcoder-greed/wiki/images/Set-Workspace.png)  
Fill in your workspace full path, make sure it's a existing directory.

4. All set! Go get your rating!

Go rock with config
-------------------

_**Everything in greed is configuable.**_

Greed is bundled with some default config, which should be enough for most of you. But if you're not satisfied, go set.

Start with creating a file called `greed.conf` under your workspace root.

Things you can do with this config, 

### greed.codeRoot

Change where your code is stored, via `greed.codeRoot = ???`, this path is relative to your workspace root.
Default set to `${Contest.Name}`, which means a folder with the name of the current contest under your workspace root.

### greed.language.\<lang\>

This is the configuration object for a specific language, including its
template definitions, template to use when submitting, and other language specific
settings.

Available language keys are `cpp`, `java`, `csharp`, and `python`.

#### Templates sequence

The key is `greed.language.<lang>.templates`.
This is the templates generated by Greed, and any dependent templates will also be generated first
(Yup, you're right, by topological order).

The default templates for each language are `[filetest, source, problem-desc]`.

* The `filetest` template uses **filetest** templates, which depends on `testcase` template. It reads data from the `testcase` output, and test your program with them. Bind to a piece of code in the `source` template.
* The `source` template generates class and method signature from the problem definition
* The `testcase` template outputs test data file to `${Problem.Name}.sample`.  
  Pay attention to its format since it's important when adding your own testcase.
  - Each testcase is identified by a labeling line which starts with `--`
  - Each line represents a parameter or the output.
  - If the data itself is an array, there should be multiple lines.
    Leading with a line with its length, and following by several lines with each of its content.
  - The input and output are separated by an empty line. (Actually, this line is ignored no matter what's in it, you can see its details in the **filetest** templates).
* The `problem-desc` template generates the problem statement into a web page.

#### Unit test

Another official template is `unittest`, but disabled by default.
This kind of template generates unit test code leveraging UT framework like `junit` for Java, `nunit` for C#, and `unittest` for Python.
To use it, set as the following (available for Java, C#, and Python):

```
greed.language.<lang>.templates = [source, unittest, problem-desc]
```

This idea was orignally proposed by @tomtung.
You can use the unittest code in your favorite IDE, like the following

#### Legacy test

Older versions of Greed write test code and test data into code, which makes the generated
code a bit messy. However, it's left for backward compatibility and users who actually like it.

```
greed.language.<lang>.templates = [test, source, problem-desc]
```

### Template definition

Magic here!

You can define your own template type, using the `templateDef` key 
under `greed.language.<lang>`. 

Here's what you're going to do.

- Specify the `overwrite` behaviour (force, backup or skip)
- Set the `outputKey` or `outputFile`, using variables like `${Problem.Name}`, `${Contest.Name}`
- **Write your awesome template**
- Set the `templateFile` to your template (relative path to your workspace)
- If you like, use some code transformers to cleanup your translated code

You can also add `afterFileGen` actions to execute scripts or programs after 
the template generation. Extreme flexibility is given.
Here's an possible example of some awesome template def.

```
greed.language.cpp.templateDef {
    awesome {
        overwrite = skip
        outputFile = "${Contest.Name}/${Problem.Name}.cool"
        templateFile = my-awesome-template.tmpl
        afterFileGen {
            execute = /usr/bin/python
            arguments = [ scripts/awesome-script.py, "${GeneratedFileName}", "${Contest.Name}/somewhere" ]
            timeout = 5
        }
    }
}
```

Remember to add your template key (`awesome` in this example) to the `templates` sequence 
for this language, or at least make another template in the sequence depends on it.

Want to learn more?
-------------------
Go to [wiki](https://github.com/shivawu/topcoder-greed/wiki). 

You'll learn how to config all the functionalities, like

* How to write your own templates (Yeh!) and provided templates
* Advanced features like template dependency, template options, template engines
* All available binded info in config, like `${Problem.Score}`
* Setting the `begin cut` and `end cut` format and other language specific configurations

Build Instructions
------------------
The Greed plugin uses gradle as a build system.
If you want to build the plugin from the source, invoke the command

```
./gradlew build     # in *NIX
gradlew.bat build   # or, in windows
```

to compile, test, and build a JAR archive (including dependencies) that can run in the arena.
The produced JAR is located at the directory 'build/libs'.

Bug Tracker
-----------
When you encounter a bug and want to see detailed log, add the following to your `greed.conf`.

```
greed.logging.logLevel = DEBUG
```

You can also see the logs by opening the javaws console when launching the arena.
Usually this can be enabled in the system-wide java control panel.
